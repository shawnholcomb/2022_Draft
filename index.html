                <p class="body-text">
                    The cabins we are looking at are 2-3 hours from DFW and current transportation plans involve a
                    couple of us driving separate vehicles. Car rental prices have skyrocketed and a passenger van would
                    cost ~ $860. The cost doesn't seem worth it for a short trip. That being said, we are hoping to meet
                    locally around 12pm on Friday. When we determine which cabin we are going to rent we will determine
                    that location. From there we will depart as a group, make stops
                    for food and drinks (I heard Rosen is bringing the chips) and arrive at the cabin together. From
                    there, shenanigans will commence. We plan on doing group meals for Friday dinner, Saturday lunch and
                    Saturday dinner and we can figure those plans in the days to come.

                    We have been kicking around the idea of moving to a Superflex league for a few years now and we

                    Below are some of the best cabin options we found. We were looking for a range of
                    options but our biggest concerns were having space to be loud and isolated from neighbors and
                    activities to keep us busy as we would be distant from bars, etc. Turns out that is harder that I
                    thought but I think we came up with some decent options.

                    We are still waiting to confirm how many in-person attendees we will have but at the moment the hope
                    is 9, because Kyle. At the moment the prices are set up with that in mind but this can change and we
                    will keep everyone up to date in the League News channel of the LXG Discord. Just a reminder, the

                                <p>Southeast of Dallas and as the title indicates, this "cabin" has a dope pool with a
                                    cool view. The outside
                                    area seems like it would be a fun place to lounge. Inside there is a tiki bar so the
                                    bartenders of the league can compete in a mojito making contest. Overall this house
                                    is pretty nice, though plain without too many extra-curricular activities to focus
                                    on (which could be an issue). The biggest concern with this place is that it is
                                    pretty close to a neighbor. They share a driveway so we are talking maybe 50 yards.
                                    The contract on this one has a specific warning about noise, which means they have
                                    likely dealt with this before, and it claims that they will evict us if they get
                                    noise complaints. No matter how much we try to keep the noise down, you guys know
                                    how it gets after everyone is half a case of White Claws deep. So that is the major
                                    concern here.

                                <p>This spot is located in Mexia, TX, which means it is less in the woods and more in
                                    the coutry surrounding a ghetto town. There is a hookah lounge about 9 miles away
                                    though, so there's that! This spot has plenty of space inside for sleeping and
                                    kicking it and the outdoor space is pretty nice. There is a sketch pool but a hot
                                    tub, fire pit and some other amenities that are spread out across the back/side
                                    yard. As eluded to before, the drawbacks on this place are the location, which is
                                    basically a low-rent area and the pool is located across the street from a neighbor.
                                    The sleeping options are also the weakest at this spot.</p>

                                <p>This place is the first true cabin in the woods. It is located near Broken Bow, OK
                                    but is not in a community and truly isolated. It is about 20 minutes from the Broken
                                    Bow Choctaw Casino but there is nothing around it. We could truly get as loud as we
                                    want. Plenty of sleeping here but the biggest draw is the ground level in this
                                    cabin. There is a long bar setup as well as hightops and beanbags with a pool table,
                                    air hockey, ping pong, darts and horseshoes. If you get bored here, that's on you
                                    baby! It's also on a creek with a firepit and hot tub. The biggest downside from
                                    this is that it is slightly further away than some options and there is wifi but it
                                    is sketchy for video streaming so remote drafting could be a challenge. There are
                                    also reviews that state they did not get cell service. Overall though, this one does
                                    appear to check the boxes of being remote and having plenty of activities for the
                                    group.</p>

                                    Okay, bear with us on this one. We spent 20 minutes looking at this venue and
                                    thought it was pretty dope before we came across the big catch but we thought we
                                    would through it out here anyways. This spot is a wedding venue that also rents out
                                    for reunions and other events. The place is nearly brand new with great provision
                                    and a private pond. Plenty of space with a nice outdoor kitchen and sitting area.
                                    The catch? There is no indoor kitchen/living area! This means that most of our time
                                    would be spent outdoors. In August. In Oklahoma. The outdoor area has a gang of fans
                                    and there is a lot of covered area. The only real indoor lounge space is a bedroom
                                    area upstairs with a small couch, a handful of beds and a shuffleboard table. It's
                                    definitely unconventional but some people may dig it. The pics would probably be
                                    good for the gram, yo!

                <p class="body-text">
                    For those flying into Dallas for the draft, your two options for airport are Dallas Fort Worth
                    International Airport (DFW) and Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL). Both options are viable with the
                    biggest difference being that DAL is the less busy option and is easier to navigate (read smaller
                    airport, but not in a bad way) than DFW. Our recommendation is to choose a
                    flight that works best for you as far as price/options go (I know you doctors are gonna be in the
                    sweet, sweet business class) and don't focus too much on the actual
                    airport.</p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Another thing to consider is the time the flight arrives. The plan is to depart
                    Dallas at 12pm so it would be great if flights arrived by 11am. This would give time to navigate the
                    airport and get to the meeting space. If you have the capability and prefer to fly in the Thursday
                    then let us know. We might be able to help out with sleeping arrangements if you want to crash on a
                    couch and we can meet up Thursday night as well!
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    The last consideration is the departure time of your flight. Remember that returning to DFW will be
                    a 2-3 hour drive. Optimally your flight wouldn't depart before 3pm, but we understand we do not live
                    in a perfect world. If you run into issues and we need to leave the cabin earlier we can make
                    arrangements. We don't want to stress anyone out with this decision so just speak with the Commish
                    and we can work with the schedules.
