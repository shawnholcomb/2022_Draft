                <p class="body-text">
                    The cabins we are looking at are 2-3 hours from DFW and current transportation plans involve a
                    couple of us driving separate vehicles. Car rental prices have skyrocketed and a passenger van would
                    cost ~ $860. The cost doesn't seem worth it for a short trip. That being said, we are hoping to meet
                    locally around 12pm on Friday. When we determine which cabin we are going to rent we will determine
                    that location. From there we will depart as a group, make stops
                    for food and drinks (I heard Rosen is bringing the chips) and arrive at the cabin together. From
                    there, shenanigans will commence. We plan on doing group meals for Friday dinner, Saturday lunch and
                    Saturday dinner and we can figure those plans in the days to come.

                    Below are some of the best cabin options we found. We were looking for a range of
                    options but our biggest concerns were having space to be loud and isolated from neighbors and
                    activities to keep us busy as we would be distant from bars, etc. Turns out that is harder that I
                    thought but I think we came up with some decent options.

                    We are still waiting to confirm how many in-person attendees we will have but at the moment the hope
                    is 9, because Kyle. At the moment the prices are set up with that in mind but this can change and we
                    will keep everyone up to date in the League News channel of the LXG Discord. Just a reminder, the

                                    Tightest on sleeping, we will definitely need to utilize couches here. The cabin is
                                    nice though, includes a pool table and appears to be near a creek with a decent
                                    outdoor space.

                                    Pretty standard cabin here, feels very open. Decent sleeping, though beds will still
                                    need to be shared. Nice outdoor seating area with fire pit and horseshoes and has a
                                    pool table inside.

                                    The big selling point for this spot is the detached game room and the covered back
                                    porch area. Also has some good outdoor activities. This cabin has the closest
                                    neighbors though so we would definitley have to be conscious of our noise levels.
                                    Sleeping is doable but people will likely be sharing beds.

                                    This cabin is very open. It has plenty of sleeping (there are bunk beds but everyone would have their own bed), a bunch of game options
                                    (pool, foosball and shuffleboard) and is more remote than some of the others with
                                    the neighbors being up the hill with plenty of trees between.

                <p class="body-text">
                    For those flying into Dallas for the draft, your two options for airport are Dallas Fort Worth
                    International Airport (DFW) and Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL). Both options are viable with the
                    biggest difference being that DAL is the less busy option and is easier to navigate (read smaller
                    airport, but not in a bad way) than DFW. Our recommendation is to choose a
                    flight that works best for you as far as price/options go (I know you doctors are gonna be in the
                    sweet, sweet business class) and don't focus too much on the actual
                    airport.</p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    Another thing to consider is the time the flight arrives. The plan is to depart
                    Dallas at 12pm so it would be great if flights arrived by 11am. This would give time to navigate the
                    airport and get to the meeting space. If you have the capability and prefer to fly in the Thursday
                    then let us know. We might be able to help out with sleeping arrangements if you want to crash on a
                    couch and we can meet up Thursday night as well!
                </p>
                <p class="body-text">
                    The last consideration is the departure time of your flight. Remember that returning to DFW will be
                    a 2-3 hour drive. Optimally your flight wouldn't depart before 3pm, but we understand we do not live
                    in a perfect world. If you run into issues and we need to leave the cabin earlier we can make
                    arrangements. We don't want to stress anyone out with this decision so just speak with the Commish
                    and we can work with the schedules.
